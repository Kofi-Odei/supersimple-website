<h2>HOBBIES</h2>
<h3>WHAT IS A HOBBY?</h3>
<p>A hobby is an activity you do in your spare time. Doing a hobby usually implies you do it quite
 regularly and you don't get paid for it. Popular hobbies tend to change over time, such as once stamp col
lecting was very popular whereas now video games are probably more sought-after these days. Most children 
have at least one they do outside of their time in school.<p>

	<p>Hobbies are often either creative and arty in nature or might be more active such as participating
 in some form of sport. There are often other amusements people may choose as a hobby and might even involve 
collecting items or objects.People have differing levels of commitment to a hobby. Usually an activity classif
ied as a hobby means they do it somewhat regularly but it may be casual where it is infrequent or short-lived 
or serious where people are really committed to a hobby. Hobbies can also be project-based where they are completed
 for a specific period of time with a specific aim.</p>

	<h3>Why do people have hobbies?</h3>
<p>Hobbies are a really great way to unwind from stress and to fill spare time. They can be an easy way to socialise
 with friends or even to meet people. They can also really help people to develop specific skills or improve their 
ability or fitness levels. Doing hobbies can give people a sense of achievement.<img src="C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads\hobbies_ver_1.png"alt="am image of types
of hobbies">

	<h3>Why are hobbies important for children?</h3>
<p>Having hobbies means children have something interesting to do outside of going to school. They can really enrich their 
lives with something else to focus on and to get good at. Whether they become amazing at gymnastics or love to paint, having
 a hobby can really give children a sense of purpose. Hobbies can take their minds off anything negative in their lives and
 improve their mental health.</p>

<p>Hobbies can also help children to socialise with other people outside of their school circle. This can increase their confidence
 as well as providing the opportunity to make more friends. They also give children the opportunity to express their creativity,
 to get fitter and get outdoors depending on the hobby. Children often spend lots of time using technology, such as phones, laptops
 and tablets, so getting them to do something different to get outside or get active is really important.</p>

<p>They can even shape children's personalities, they might become more independent, confident or be able to think more effectively.
 They can also improve children's ability to work in a team or to be a leader which can help them throughout their lives.
Good hobbies for children help them to develop, they give them moral, social, creative and even academic skills. Having hobbies
 as a child can help them to do well later in life, from a personal and professional point of view.</p>

	<h3>How to encourage children to take up hobbies</h3>
<p>Letting children choose their own hobbies is really important to gauge their genuine interest. If it's something they really
 want to do, they are much more likely to stick at it.That doesn't mean getting children into the same hobby as adults is a negative thing.
 Parents and children doing hobbies together
can really help them bond and if they watch adults doing something fun they are likely to want to join in.</p>
